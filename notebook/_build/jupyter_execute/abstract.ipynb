    "Financial planning tools can be a double edge sword for consumers as most tools of today lack sufficient theoretical background or are used for commercial purposes. To tackle the shortcomings of today's financial planning tools, we delve into a Machine Learning subfield called Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement Learning has seen great advancement in the past decade and is becoming a comprehensive field in which financial tools can be better tailored for the consumer. More specifically, the recent co√∂peration between reinforcement learning and planning domains like optimal control enable algorithms to not just learn the environment, but also to be able to plan ahead. Given the fact that these algorithms can be widely generic and can thus be employed in a tailored financial environment for the consumer, makes the Reinforcement literature an interesting field for future financial planning tools. Inspired by this idea, the general theory of Reinforcement learning is introduced together with the most fundamental algorithms. Furthermore, a closer look will be given at the dimensions of a model-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Thereafter, The current challenges in Reinforcement Learning are discussed together with Deep Reinforcement Learning, which tackles the biggest hurdle in Reinforcement Learning called the Curse of Dimensionality. Next, the possible implications of Reinforcement Learning for financial planning are considered. Finally, two financial applications are introduced. "
