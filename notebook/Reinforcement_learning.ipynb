    "Supervised and unsupervised learning are the two most widely studied and researched branches of Machine Learning (ML). Besides these two, there is also a third subcategory in ML called Reinforcement Learning (RL). The three branches have fundamental differences between each other. Supervised learning for example is designed to learn from a training set of labeled data, where each element of the training set describes a certain situation and is linked to a label/action the supervisor has provided {cite}`hammoudeh2018concise`. On the other hand, RL is a method in which the machine tries to map situations to actions by maximizing a reward signal {cite}`arulkumaran2017brief`. The two methods are fundamentally different from each other in the fact that in RL there is no supervisor which provides the label/action the machine needs to take, rather there is a reward system set up from which the machine can learn the correct action/label {cite}`hammoudeh2018concise`. contrarily to supervised learning, unsupervised learning tries to find hidden structures within an unlabeled dataset. This might seem similar to RL as both methods work with unlabeled datasets, but RL tries to maximize a reward signal instead of finding only hidden structures in the data {cite}`arulkumaran2017brief`. Unsupervised learning on the other hand learns about how the data is distributed {cite}`shin2019reinforcement`.\r\n",

    "RL finds its roots in multiple research fields. Each of these fields contributes to the RL in its own unique way (see {numref}`Figure {number} <tree-fig>`) {cite}`hammoudeh2018concise`. For example,  RL is similar to natural learning processes where the learning method is by experiencing many failures and successes. Therefore psychologists have used RL to mimic psychological processes when an organism makes choices based on experienced rewards/punishments {cite}`eckstein2021reinforcement`. While psychologists are mimicking psychological processes, neuroscientists are using RL to focus on a well-defined network of regions of the brain that implement value learning {cite}`eckstein2021reinforcement`.

    "RL can be represented in finite Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are classical formalizations of sequential decision making. More specifically, MPDs give rise to a structure in which delayed rewards can be balanced with immediate rewards {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. It also enables a straightforward framing of learning from interaction to achieve a goal {cite}`levine2018reinforcement`. In its simplest form, RL works with an Agent-Environment Interface. The agent is exposed to some representation of the environment's state $S_t \\in \\mathrm{S}$. From this representation the agent needs to chose an action $ A_t \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)$, which will result in a numerical reward $R_{t+1} \\in \t\\mathbb{R} $ and a new state $S_{t+1}$ (see {numref}`Figure {number} <standard_model-fig>`)  {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`.

    "A key concept of MPDs is the Markov property: Only the current state affects the next state {cite}`franccois2018introduction`. The random variables (RV) $R_t$ and $S_t$ have then well defined discrete transition probability distributions dependent only on the previous state and action: \r\n",

This is an unrealistic assumption to make, and several algorithms relax the Markov property. The Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) algorithm, for example, maintains a belief over the current state given the previous belief state, the action taken, and the current observation {cite}`arulkumaran2017brief`.  Once $p$ is known, the environment is fully described and functions like a transition function $T : D \\times A \\to p(S)$ and a reward function $R: S \\times A \\times S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can be deducted {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`.\r\n",

    "A general theory in finding the optimal policy $\\pi_*$ is called Generalized Policy Iteration (GLI). This method is applied to almost all RL algorithms. The main idea behind GLI is that there is a process that evaluates the value function of the current policy $\\pi$ called policy evaluation and a process that improves the current value function called policy improvement {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`, {cite}`van2012reinforcement`. To find the optimal policy these two processes work in tandem with each other as seen in {numref}`Figure {number} <GPI-fig>` {cite}`van2012reinforcement`. Counterintuitively, these processes also work in a conflicting manner as policy improvement makes the policy incorrect and it is thus no longer the same policy {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`,  {cite}`barreto2020fast`. While policy evaluations create a consistent policy and thus the policy no longer improves upon itself. This idea runs in parallel with the balance between exploration and exploitation in RL.  If the focus lies more on exploration, the agent frequently tries to find states which improve the value function. However, putting more emphasis on exploration is a costly setting as the agent will more frequently choose suboptimal policies to explore the state space. If exploitation is prioritized, the agent will take a long time to find the optimal policy as the agent is likely not to explore new states to improve the policy {cite}`van2012reinforcement`.  An $\\varepsilon$-greedy algorithm is a good example of an algorithm where the balance between exploration and exploitation is important. "

    "Reinforcement Learning can be subdivided between model-based RL and model-free RL. In model-free RL the dynamics of the environment are not known. $\\pi_*$ is found by purely interacting with the environment. Meaning that these algorithms do not use transition probability distribution and reward function related to MDP {cite}`franccois2018introduction`. Moreover, model-free RL has irreversible access to the environment. Meaning the algorithm has to move forward after an action is taken {cite}`moerland2020model`. Model-based RL on the other hand has reversible access to the environment because they can revert the model and make another trail from the same state {cite}`moerland2020framework`. Good examples of model-free RL techniques are the Q-learning and Sarsa. They tend to be used on a variety of tasks, like playing video games to learning complicated locomotion skills {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. Model-free RL lay at the foundation of RL and are the first algorithms to be applied in RL were model-free RL techniques. On the other hand, model-based RL is developed independently and in parallel with planning methods like optimal control and the search community as they both solve the same problem but differ in the approach {cite}`wang2019exploration`. Most algorithms in model-based RL have a model which describes the dynamics of the environment. They sample from that model to then improve a learned value or policy function {cite}`moerland2020framework` (see {numref}`Figure {number} <model_based_RL>`). This enables the agent to think in advance and as it were plan for possible actions. Model-based reinforcement learning finds thus large similarities with the Planning literature and as a result, a lot of cross-breeding between the two is happening. For example, an extension of the POMP algorithm called Partially Observable Multi-Heuristic Dynamic Programming (POMHDP) is based on recent progress from the search community {cite}`kim2019pomhdp`. A hybrid version of the two approaches in which the model is learned through interaction with the environment, has also been widely applied. The imagination-augmented agents (12A) for example combines model-based and model-free aspects by employing the predictions as an additional context in a deep policy network {cite}``moerland2020model.  In the next subsection, three fundamental algorithms in RL are discussed which will enable us to better capture the dimensions and challenges of RL algorithms.\r\n"

    "Dynamic Programming (DP) is known for two algorithms in RL: value iteration (VI) and policy iteration (PI). For both methods, the dynamics of the environment need to be completely known and they ,therefore, fall under model-based RL. The two algorithms also use a discrete time, state and action MDP as they are iterative procedures. The PI can be subdivided into three steps: initialize, policy evaluation and policy improvement {cite}`van2012reinforcement`. The first step is to initialize the value function $v_{\\pi}$ by choosing an arbitrary policy $\\pi$. The following step is to evaluate the function successively by updating the Bellman equation {eq}`BELL`. Updating on the Bellman equation is also called the expected update as the equation is updated using the whole state space instead of a sample of the state space. One update is also called a sweep as the update sweeps through the state space. Once that the value function $v_{\\pi}$ is updated, we know how good it is to follow the current policy. The next step is to deviate from the policy trajectory and choose a different action $a$ in state $s$ to find a more optimal policy value. We compute the new $\\pi '$ and compare it to the old policy. The new policy is accepted if $\\pi '(s) > \\pi(s)$. This process is repeated until a convergence criterion is met {cite}`pashenkova1996value`. The complete algorithm can be found in the appendix. VI combines the policy evaluation with the policy improvement by truncating the sweep with one update of each state. It effectively combines the policy evaluation and policy evaluation in one sweep (see appendix for the algorithm) {cite}`pashenkova1996value` . PI and VI are the foundation of DP and numerous adaptions have been made to these algorithms. Although these algorithms do not have a wide application in many fields, their essential in describing what an RL algorithm effectively tries to approximate {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. "

    "The Monte Carlo (MC) methods do not assume full knowledge of the dynamics of the environment and are thus considered model-free RL techniques. They only require a sample sequence of states, actions and rewards from the interaction of an environment. Technically, a model is still required which generates sample transitions, but the complete probability distribution $p$ of the dynamic system is not necessary. The idea behind almost all MC methods is that the agent learns the optimal policy by averaging the sample returns of a policy $\\pi$ {cite}`arulkumaran2017brief`. They can therefore not learn on an online basis as after each episode they need to average their returns. Another difference between the two methods is that the MC method does not bootstrap like DP {cite}`mondal2020survey` . Meaning, each state has an independent estimate. Note that Monte Carlo methods create a nonstationary problem as each action taken at a state depends on the previous states. MC methods can either estimate $a$ state value {eq}`state-value` or estimate the value of a state-action pairs {eq}`value` (recall that the state-action values are the value of an action given a state). If state values are estimated, a model is required as it needs to be able to look ahead one step and choose the action which leads to the best reward and next state. With action value estimation you already estimated the value of the action and no model needs to be taken into account.  Monte Carlo methods also use a term called visits. A visit is when a state or state-action pair is in the sample path. Multiple visits to a state are possible in an episode. Two general Monte Carlo Methods can be deducted from visits. The every-visit MC methods and the first-visit MC methods. The every-visit MC methods estimate the value of a state as the average of the returns that have followed all visits to it. The first visit method only looks at the first visit of that state to estimate the average returns {cite}`van2012reinforcement`. The biggest hurdle in MC methods is that most state-action pairs might never be visited in the sample.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To overcome this problem multiple solutions have been explored. The naïve solution to this problem is called the exploring starts. Here, the idea is to allocate to each action in each state a nonzero probability at the start of the process. Although this is not possible in a practical setting where we truly want to interact with an environment, it enables us to improve the policy by making it greedy with respect to the current value function. As each state has a certain probability to explore, it will eventually explore the complete state space. If then an infinite number of episodes are taken, the policy improvement theory states that the policy $\\pi$ will convergence to the optimal policy $\\pi_*$ given the exploring starts {cite}`dolk2010survey`. Two other possibilities are applied in the field to solve this problem: on-policy methods and off-policy methods {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. On-policy methods attempt to improve on the current policy. This is also called a soft policy as $\\pi(a|s) > 0$ for all $s \\in S$ and all $ a \\in A(s)$, but shifts eventually to the deterministic optimal policy. One of these on-policy methods is called an $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy. The $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy uses with probability $\\varepsilon$ a random action instead of the greedy action. $\\varepsilon$ is a fine-tuning parameter as it sets the balance between exploration and exploitation. The $\\varepsilon$-soft policy is thus also a compromised solution as one cannot exploit and explore at the same rate. This is reelected by the fact that the $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy is the best policy only among the $\\varepsilon$-soft policies. The pseudocode of on-policy first visit MC for $\\varepsilon$-soft policies algorithm can be found in the appendix. Lastly, the off-policy methods can be applied to overcome both the unrealistic exploring starts and the compromise needed in the on-policy methods. Off policy methods solve the exploration versus exploitation dilemma by considering two separate policies {cite}`van2012reinforcement`. one policy, called the target policy $\\pi$, is being learned to become the optimal policy and another policy, called the behavior policy $b$, generates the behavior to explore the state space. In an off-policy method there needs to be coverage between the behavior policy and the target policy to transfer the exploration done by behavior policy $b$ to the target policy $\\pi$. Meaning, every action taken under $\\pi$ also needs to be taken occasionally under $b$. Consequently, the behavior policy needs to be stochastic in states where it deviates from the target policy. Complete coverage would imply that the behavior policy and the target policy are the same. The off-policy method would then become an on-policy method. The on-policy method can thus be viewed as a special case of off-policy in which the two policies are the same. Most off-policy methods use importance sampling to estimate expected values under one distribution given samples from another. Importance sampling uses the ratio of returns according to the relative probability of the trajectories of the target and behavior policies to learn the optimal policy {cite}`mahmood2014weighted`: \r\n",

The sampling estimate differs from the expected estimate on the fact that they are based on a single sample successor rather than on the complete distribution of all possible successors {cite}`li2016survey`. In the updating rule of TD methods there is the TD error (see quantity in brackets) which is the difference between the previous estimate of $S_t$ and the updated estimate  $R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1} - V(S_t)$. The TD error is the error in the estimate made at that time. The psuedocode of the one-step TD method can be found in the appendix. TD methods lend themself quite easily to different methods in MC. For example, the Sarsa control algorithm is an on-policy TD in which the action values are updates using state-action pairs {cite}`li2016survey`: \r\n",

    "{cite}`moerland2020framework` addresses the six most critical dimensions of an RL algorthim: computational effort, action value selection, cumulative return estimation, policy evaluation, function representation and update method. The first dimension has to do with the computational effort that is required to run the algorithm. The computational effort is primarily determined by the state set that is chosen (see {numref}`Figure {number} <state_space-fig>`). The first option is to consider all states $S$ of the dynamic environment. In practice, this often becomes impractical to consider due to the curse of dimensionality. The second and third possibilities are all reachable states and all relevant states. All reachable states are the states which are reachable from any start under any policy, while for the relevant states only those states under the optimal policy are considered. The last option is to use start states. These are all the states with a non-zero probability under $p(s_0)$. The curse of dimensionality is further discussed in the next subsection as it is one of the primary challenges in RL. \r\n",

    "The second dimension is the action selection and has primarily to due to with exploration process of the algorithm. The first consideration in action selection is the candidate set that is considered for the next action. Then the optimal action needs to be considered while still keeping exploration in mind. For selecting the candidate set two main approaches are considered: step-wise and frontier. Frontier methods only start exploration once they are on the frontier, while step-wise methods have a new candidate set at each step of the trajectory. the MC method, DP and TD learning described above use step-wise exploration, while frontier methods are primarly used in robotics {cite}`8606991`. For the second consideration, selecting the action value,  different methods have been adopted. The first one is random explorations like $\\varepsilon$-greedy exploration as explained in the section of Monte Carlo methods. These explorations techniques enable us to escape from a local minimum but can cause a jittering effect in which we undo an exploration step at random. The second approach is a value-based exploration that uses the value-based information to better direct the perturbation {cite}`yasuiempirical`. A good example of this are mean action values. They improve the random exploration by incorporating the mean estimates of all the available actions. Meaning, they explore actions with higher values more frequently than actions with lower values. The last option is state-based exploration. State-based exploration uses state-dependent properties to inject noise. Dynamic programming is a good example of this approach. DP is an ordered state-based exploration. Ordered state-based exploration sweeps through the state space in orded like tree structure. Other state-based explorations are possible like novelty and priors. "

For the sample depth three possible option are possible: $K = \\infty$, $K = 1$,  $K = n$ or reweighted. Monte Carlo methods for example use a sample depth to infinity as they do not bootstrap at all. Instead, DP uses bootstrapping at each iteration, so $K = 1$. An intermediate method between DP and Monte Carlo methods can also be devised in which $ K = n$. The reweighted option is a special case of $ K = n$ in which targets of different depths are combined with a weighting scheme. The bootstrap function can be devised using a learned value function like the state value function or the state-action value function or following a heuristic approach. A good heuristic can be obtained by first solving a simplified version of the problem. An example of this is first solving the deterministic problem and then using the solution as a heuristic on its stochastic counterpart {cite}`moerland2020framework`. The second dimension in cumulative return estimation is whether full knowledge of the dynamic system is in place (full backups) or a sample is taken from the environment (sample backups) {cite}`arulkumaran2017brief`.

    "The fourth dimension to consider is policy evaluation. Policy evaluation has two dimensions. One is on which policy to use: on-policy or off-policy method. We have already seen this dimension in the section of MC methods and it will not be further discussed. Another dimension is function representation. The first choice that needs to be made here is which function to represent. In theory, we have two essential functions: the value function and the policy function. The value function can be the state-action value function or just the state value function, but primarily represents the value of the current or optimal policy at all considered state-action pairs. The policy function on the other hand maps every state to a probability distribution over actions and is best used in continuous action spaces as we can directly act in the environment by sampling from the policy distribution {cite}`moerland2020framework`. The second choice is how to represent this function. There are two possibilities here. The first option is using a tabular approach in which each state is a unique element for which we store an individual estimate.  This can be done on a global level or local level. At the global level, the entire state space is encapsulated by the table. Unfortunately, this method does not scale well and is only appliable in small exploratory problems. On the contrary, a local table does scale well as it is built temporarily until the next real step. The other method for function representation is function approximation. Function approximation builds on the concept of generalization. Generalization assumes that similar states to function will in general also have approximately similar output predictions (Generalization is further discussed in next section).  Function approximation uses this to share information between near similar states and therefore store a global solution for a larger state space {cite}van2012reinforcement. There are two kinds of function approximations: parametric and non-parametric. A good example of a parametric function approximation is a neural network and for non-parametric a k-nearest neighbors can be thought of. The big challenge in function approximation is finding the balance between overfitting and underfitting the actual data.\r\n",

    "The last dimension is the updating method. The updating method used should be in line with the function representation and the policy evaluation method as certain updating rules only work on a set of function representation and policy evaluation methods {cite}`moerland2020framework`. For the updating method, there are quite a few choices to make. The first choice is choosing between gradient-based updates and gradient-free updates. In gradient-based updates we repeatedly update our parameters in the direction of the negative gradient loss with respect to the parameters:\r\n",

The loss function is usually a function of both the function representation and the policy evaluation method. As there are two kinds of function to represent in function representation, there are also two kinds of losses: value loss and policy loss. The most general value loss is the mean squared error loss. In policy loss, there are various methods to estimating the loss. For example the policy gradient specifies a relation between the value estimates $\\hat{q}(s_t,a_t)$ and the policy $\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)$ by ensuring that actions with high values also get high policy probabilities assigned: \r\n",

Also, when the action and state space are continuous, we have an infinite amount of possible state-action pairs to explore, making the tabular approach impossible {cite}`shin2019reinforcement`.

    "Q-learning learns extremely slow in noisy environments due to the minimization bias. In {eq}`Q-learning` the minimum over the estimated values is used implicitly as an estimate of the minimum value, which can lead to significant positive bias in noisy environments. Consider, for example, a single state $s$ where there are many actions $a$ whose true values are all zero but whose estimated values are uncertain and thus distributed some above and some below zero. The minimum of the true values is zero, but the minimum of the estimates is negative. Consequently, introducing minimization bias {cite}´sutton2018reinforcement´. This can also be illustrated by the Jensen's inequality for the concave min operator. Assume that $Q(s,a)$ is an unbiased but noisy estimate of the optimal $Q^*(s,a)$. Then it applieas that \r\n",

    "This creates an optimistic bias, causing the cost-to-go to appear lower than it is. The minimization bias has an impact on the learning rate of the Q-learning policy. The impact depends on the gap $Q^*(s,a') - V^*(s)$  between the value of a non-optimal action $a'$ and that of the optimal action. If the gap is large, $a'$ seems suboptimal as desired. If the gap is small, confusing $a'$ for the optimal action does not effect the learning process. However, when the gap is in the order of the noise term, the minimization bias has a significant impact, because $a'$ does not appear to be suboptial and is thus still accepted as optimal. The optimstic bias is futher enhanced by propegating the bias between states and can lead to regions of the state space that are highly biased creating large-gap suboptimal actions. Although this problem hampers the learning rate, Q-learning can still learn in a stochstic environment due to the fact that the bias draws exploration towards the given state, leading to a decrease in variance, which in turn reduces the bias {cite}`fox2015taming`. \r\n",

Penilazation is done early in the process, because there is still a small sample size and therefore a more randomized policy is prefered. When the sample size grows, one should expect to shifts to a more deterministic and exploiting policy. This is what G-learning effectively does.

    "An other way to look at it is that the stochastic control problem is a model-based reinforcement learning problem {cite}`han2018solving`. In this setting $Z$ is viewed as the policy we try to approximate using a feedforward neural network. The process $u(t, \\varepsilon + W_t), t \\in [0, T]$, corresponds to the value function associated with the stochastic control problem and can be approximately employed by the policy Z {cite}`weinan2017deep`. A benefit of using deep BSDE method is it does not require us to generate training data beforehand. The paths play the role of the data and they are generated on the spot {cite}`weinan2020algorithms`. \r\n",
