    "Supervised and unsupervised learning are the two most widely studied and researched branches of Machine Learning (ML). Besides these two, there is also a third subcategorie in ML called Reinforcement Learning (RL). The three branches have fundamental differences between eachother. Supervised learning for example is designed to learn from a training set of labeled data, where each element of the training set describes a certain situation and is linked to a label/action the supervisor has provided {cite}`hammoudeh2018concise`. RL on the other hand is a method in which the machine tries to map situation to actions by maximizing a reward signal {cite}`arulkumaran2017brief`. The two methods are fundementally different from each other on the fact that in RL there is no supervisor which provides the label/action the machine needs to take, rather there is a reward system set up from which the machine can learn the correct action/label {cite}`hammoudeh2018concise`. contrarily to supervised learning, unsupervised learning tries to find hidden structures within an unlabeled dataset. This might seem similar to RL as both methods work with unlabeled datasets, but RL tries to maximize a reward signal instead of finding only hidden structures in the data {cite}`arulkumaran2017brief`. \n",
    "\n",
    "RL finds it roots in multiple research fields. Each of these fields contributes to the RL in its own unique way (see figure) {cite}`hammoudeh2018concise`. For example,  RL is similar to natural learning processes where the method of learning is by experiencing many failures and successes. Therefore psychologists have used RL to mimic psychological processes when an organism makes choices based on experienced rewards/punishments {cite}`eckstein2021reinforcement`. While psychologists are mimicing psychological processes, Nueroscientists are using RL to focus on a well-defined network or regions of the brain that implement value learning {cite}`eckstein2021reinforcement`.

    "RL can be represented in finite Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are classical formalizations of sequantial decision making. More specifically, MPDs give rise to a structure in which delayed rewards can be balanced with immediate rewards {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. It also enables a straightforward framing of learning from interaction to achieve a goal {cite}`levine2018reinforcement`. In it's most simplest form RL works with an Agent-Environment Interface. The agent is exposed to some representation of the environment's state $S_t \\in \\mathrm{S}$. From this representation the agent needs to chose an action $ A_t \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)$, which will result in a numerical reward $R_{t+1} \\in \t\\mathbb{R} $ and a new state $S_{t+1}$ (see figure 2) {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. The goal for the agent is to learn a mapping from states to action called a policy $\\pi$ that maximizes the expected rewards:\n",

    "A general theory in finding the optimal policy $\\pi_*$ is called Generelized Policy Iteration (GLI). This method is applied to almost all RL algorithms. The main idea behind GLI is that there is a process which evaluates the value function of the current policy $\\pi$ called policy evaluation and a process which improves the current value function called policy improvement {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. To find the optimal policy these two processes work in tandem with eachother as seen in figure ... Counterintuitively, these processes also work in a conflicting manner as policy improvement makes the policy incorrect and it is thus no longer the same policy {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. While policy evaluations creates a consistent policy and thus the policy no longer improves upon itself. This idea runs in parallel with the balance between exploration and exploitation in RL.  If the focus lies more on exploration, the agent frequently tries to find states which improve the value function. However, putting more emphasis on exploration is a costly setting as the agent will more frequenlty choose suboptimal policies to explore the state space. If exploitation is prioritised, the agent will take a long time to find the optimal policy as the agent is likely not to explore new states to improve the policy.  is a good example of the influential balance between exploration and exploitation.

    "Reinforcement Learning can be subdivided between model-based RL and model-free RL. In model-free RL the dynamics of the environment are not known. $\\pi_*$ is found by purily interacting with the environment. Meaning that these algorithms do not use transition probability distribution and reward function related to MDP. Moreover, model-free RL have irreversible access to the environment. Meaning the algorithm has to move forward after an action is taken. Model-based RL on the other hand have reversible access to the environment because they are able to revert the model and make another trail from the same state {cite}`moerland2020framework`. Good examples of model-free RL techniques are the Q-learning and Policy Optimization algorithms. They tend to be used on a variety of tasks, like playing video games to learning complicated locomotion skills. Model-free RL lay at the fundation of RL and are one of the first algorithms to be applied in RL. On the other hand, model-based RL is developed independently and in parallel with planning methods like optimal control and the search community as they both solve the same problem but differ in the approach. Most algorithms in model-based RL have a model which describes the dynamics of the environment. They sample from that model to then improve a learned value or policy function {cite}`moerland2020framework`(see figure). This enables the agent to think in advance and as it were plan for possible actions. Model-based reinforcement learning finds thus large similarities with the Planning literature and as a result a lot of cross breeding between the two is happening. For example an extension of the POMP algorithm called Partially Observable Multi-Heuristic Dynammic Programming (POMHDP) is based on recent progress from the search community {cite}`kim2019pomhdp`. A hybrid version of the two approaches in which the model is learned through interaction with the environment, has also been widely applied. The imagination-augmented agents (12A) for example combines model-based and model-free aspects by employing the predictions as additional context in a deep policy network.  In the next subsection three fundamental algorithms in RL are discussed which will enable us to better capture the dimensions and challenges of a RL algorithms.\r\n"

    "Dynammic Programming (DP) is known for two algorithms in RL: value iteration (VI) and policy iteration (PI). For both methodes the dynamics of the environment need to be completly known and they therefore fall under model-based RL. The two algorithms also use a discrete time, state and action MDP as they are iterative procedures. The PI can be subdivided into three steps: initialize, policy evaluation and policy improvement. The first step is to initialize the value function $v_{\\pi}$ by choosing an arbitrary policy $\\pi$. The following step is to evaluate the function successively by updating the the Bellman equation eq 2.1 . Updating on the Bellman equation is also called the expected update as the equation is updated using the whole state space instead of a sample of the state space. One update is also called a sweep as the update sweeps through the state space. Now that we have updated the value function $v_{\\pi}$, we know how good it is to follow the current policy. The next step is to deviate from the policy trajectory and chose a different action a in state s to find a more optimal policy value. We compute the new $\\pi '$ and compare it to the old policy. The new policy is accepted if $\\pi '(s) > \\pi(s)$. This process is repeated untill a convergence criteria is met. The complete algorithm can be found in the appendix. VI combines the policy evaluation with the policy improvement by truncating the sweep with one update of each state. It effectivily combines the policy evaluation and policy evaluation in one sweep (see appendix for algorithm) {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. PI and VI are the foundation of DP and numerous adaptions have been made on these algorithms. For example have... . Adaptive Dynammic programming is  \r\n",

    "The Monte Carlo (MC) methods do not assume full knowledge of the dynamics of the environment and are thus considered model-free RL techniques. They only require a sample sequence of states, actions and rewards from interaction of an environment. Techniquely, a model is still required which generates sample transitions, but the complete probability distribtion $p$ of the dynammic system is not neccesary. The idea behind almost all MC methods is that the agent learns the optimal policy by averaging the sample returns of a policy $\\pi$. They can therefore not learn on an online basis as after each episode they need to average their returns. Another difference between the two methods is that the MC method does not bootstrap like DP. Meaning, each state has an independed estimate. Note that Monte Carlo methods create a nonstationary problem as each action taken at a state depends on the previous states. MC methods can either estimate  a state value (eq) or  estimate the value of a state-action pairs (eq) (recall that the state-action values are the value of an action given a state). If state values are estimated, a model is required as it needs to be able to look ahead one step and choose the action which leads to the best reward and next state. With action value estimation you already estimated the value of the action and no model needs to be taken into account.  Monte Carlo methods also use a term called visits. A visit is when a state or state-action pair is in the sample path. Multiple visits to a state are possible in an episode. Two general Monte Carlo Methods can be deducted from visits. The every-visit MC methods and the first-visit MC methods. The every-visit MC methods estimates the value of a state as the average of the returns that have followed all visits to it. The first visit method only looks at the first visit of that state to estimate the average returns. The biggest hurdle in MC methods is that most state-action pairs might never be visited in the sample.\r\n",

    "To overcome this problem multiple solutions have been explored. The naïve solution to this problem is called the exploring starts. Here, the idea is to allocate to each action in each state a nonzero probability at the start of the process. Although this is not possible in a practical setting where we truly want to interact with an environment, it enables us to improve to policy by making it greedy with respect to the current value function. If an infinite number of episodes are taken, the policy improvement theory states that the policy $\\pi$ will convergence too the optimal policy $\\pi_*$ given the exploring starts. The other two possibilities are on-policy methods and off-policy methods {cite}`sutton2018reinforcement`. On-policy methods attempt to improve on the current policy. This is also called a soft policy as $\\pi(a|s) > 0$ for all $s \\in S$ and all $ a \\in A(s)$, but shifts eventual to the deterministic optimal policy. One of these on-policy methods uses a $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy. The $\\varepsilon$-greedy policy uses with probability $\\varepsilon$ a random action instead of the greedy action. A pseudocode of on-policy first visit MC for $\\varepsilon$-soft policies algorithm can be found in the appendix. \r\n",

    "{cite}`moerland2020framework` adresses the six most important dimensions of a RL algortihm: computational effort, action value selection, cumulative return estimation, policy evaluation, function representation and update method. The first dimension has to do with the computational effort that is required to run the algorithm. This has primarely to do with the state set that is chosen (see figure). The first option is to consider all states $S$ of the dynamic environment. In practice this often becomes impractical to consider due to the curse of dimensionality. The second and third possibilities are all reachable states and all relevant states. All reachable states are the states which are reachable from any start under any policy, while for the relevant states only those state under the optimal policy are considered. The last option is to use start states. These are all the states with a non-zero probability under $p(s_0)$  \r\n",

    "The second dimension is the action selection and has primarly to due to with exploration process of the algorithm. The first consideration is the candidate set that is considered for the next action. Then the optimal action needs to be considered while still keeping exploration in mind. For selecting the candidate set two main approaches are considered: step-wise and frontier. Frontier methods only start exploration once they are on the frontier, while step-wise methods have a new candidate set at each step of the trajectory. the second consideration, selecting the acion value,  different methods have been adopted. The first one are random explorations like $\\varepsilon$-greedy exploration as explained in the section of Monte Carlo methods. These explorations techniques enable us to escape from a local minimum but can cause a jittering effect in which we undo an exploration step at random. The second approach is value-based exploration which uses the value-based information to better direct the pertubation. A good example of this are mean action values. They improve the random exploration by incorporating the mean estimates of all the available actions. Meaning, they explore actions with higher values more frequenlty than actions with lower values. The last option is state-based exploration. State-based exploration uses state-dependedent properties to inject noise. The dynammic programming (section...) is a good example of this approach. DP is an ordered state-based exploration. Ordered state-based exploration sweeps through the state space in orded like tree structure. Other state-based exploration are possible like novelty and priors. "

For the sample depth three possible option are possible: $K = \\infty$, $k = 1$,  $k = n$ or reweighted. Monte Carlo methods for example use a sample depth to infinity as they do not bootstrap at all. Instead, DP uses bootstrapping at each iteration, so $k = 1$. An intermediate method between DP and Monte Carlo methods can also be deviced in which $ k = n$. The reweighted option is a special case of $ k = n$ in which tragets of different depths are combined with a weighting scheme. The bootstrap function can be devised using a learned value function like state value function or the state-action value function or following a heuristic approach. A good heuristic can be obtained by first solving a simplified version of the problem. An example of this is first solving the deterministic problem and then using the solution as a heirstic on its stochastic counterpart. \r\n",

    "The fourth dimension to consider is policy evaluation. Policy evaluation has two dimension. One is on which policy is used: on-policy or off-policy method. The other is whether the dynamics of the environment are known: expected or sample method. We have already seen these dimensions in section ... and they will not be further discussed but they are essential for making decision in policy evaluation. Another dimension is function representation. The first choice that needs to be made here is which function to represent. In theory we have two essential functions: the value function and the policy function. The value function can be the state-action value function or just the state value function, but primarly represents the value of the current or optimal policy at all considered state-action pairs. The policy function on the other hand maps every state to a probability distribution over actions and is best used in continuous action spaces as we can directly act in the environment by sampling from the policy distribution. The second choice is how to represent this function. There are two possibilties here. The first option is using a tabular approach in which each state is a unique element for which we store an individual estimate.  This can be done on a global level or local level. At the global level the entire state space is encapsuled by the table. Unfortunatly, this method does not scale well and is only appliable in small examplory problems. On the contrary, a local table does scale well as it is build temporarily until the next real step. The other method for function  representation is function approximation. Function approximation builds on the concept of generalization... Generalization assumes that similar states to function will in general also have approximatly similar output predictions. Function approximation uses this to share information between near similar states and therefore store a global solution for a larger state space. There are two kinds of function approximations: parametric and non-parametric. \r\n",
