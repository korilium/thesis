    "The financial decisions that consumers need to make in their present lifetime, become increasingly more complex. A good example of this phenomenon is the shift from defined benefits to defined contributions in which consumers take on greater individual responsibility and risks. The evolution in the abstruseness of financial products has become challenging for consumers who possess low financial knowledge and limiting numeracy skills {cite}`bi2017financial`. Combined with uncertainty about the future, the consumer is necessitated to be more aware of his financial well-being than ever before. Looking back into the past, Porteba et al, {cite}`poterba2011were` conducted an examination of preparedness in retirement for Children of Depression, War Baby, and the Early Baby Boomer in the Health and Retirement Study and Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old cohorts. They found that 46.1 percent die with less than 10 000 dollars. With this amount of assets, they would not have the capacity to pay for unexpected events and one might wonder if it is adequate asset levels for retirement. Furthermore, saving behavior has not kept pace with increasing life expectation and the expected prolonged lifespan of the coming generations are unprecedented {cite}`hershfield2011future`. All these elements give a painstakingly clear picture that having a vital understanding of one's financial situation has become one of the greatest challenges in life.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To combat these difficulties, consumers require additional undertakings in planning for their future prosperity. One of the approaches to tackle this issue, is by using financial planning tools. These tools give the consumer the capability to estimate complex intertemporal calculations {cite}`bi2020limitations`. They also enhance financial behavior, increase household wealth accumulation and they are a complement to other planning aid like a financial advisor {cite}`bi2017financial`. Although financial planning tools can greatly benefit consumers, it can also be a double-edged sword. More specifically, when consumers are misinformed about the capabilities of the tool, or when the design of the tool is inadequate, the consumer can be given sub-optimal advice or even misleading advice {cite}`dorman2018efficacy`. Insufficiencies in design can arise when not all essential input variables are included, not all risks are considered, and when accuracy is sacrificed for the ease of use {cite}`bi2020limitations`. On top of that, there are wide variations in results because of the various methodology and assumptions used in the models {cite}`dorman2018efficacy`. For example, assumptions based on inflation and the use of different financial products have a large impact on the results. On the side of the consumer, the possibility of misunderstanding the implications of the results due to a lack of financial knowledge, is a matter of great concern in the eyes of financial educators {cite}`bi2020limitations`. Clarifying the results is therefore an essential part of making models operational. To improve upon these deficiencies, Dorman et al., {cite}`dorman2018efficacy` found that when the models handle additional theoretical variables, the accuracy will improve. Besides, they found that the consumer requires unique solutions that better capture their financial situation. Meaning planning tools need to be more flexible. They should be able to operate in different financial settings and have the ability to look at the impact of changes in input variables. To address the variability in results and the adaptability of models to different settings, this paper will look at reinforcement learning techniques in an intertemporal setting. Reinforcement Learning enables an increase in the flexibility of the model while keeping fundamental theoritical aspects like Optimal Control Theory at its core. \r\n",

    "For the remainder of the paper, the general theory of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) will first be discussed. Then, we will go more into depth on Dynammic Programming which is one of the pillar stones of Reinforcement Learning. Next, a deep Backward Stochastic Differential Equation method is discussed which will solve the Terminal Partial Differential Equation of the dynammic programming system in higher dimensions. Lastly, an example which will implement this method is presented. "

    "Supervised and unsupervised learning are the two most widely studied and researched branches of Machine Learning (ML). Besides these two, there is also a third subcategorie in ML called Reinforcement Learning (RL). Supervised learning is designed to learn from a training set of labeled data, where each element of the training set describes a certain situation and is linked to a label/action the supervisor has provided. RL on the other hand is a method in which the machine tries to map situation to actions by maximizing a reward signal. The two methods are fundementally different from each other on the fact that in RL there is no supervisor which provides the label/action the machine needs to take, rather there is a reward system set up from which the machine can learn the correct action/label. contrarily to supervised learning, unsupervised learning tries to find hidden structures within an unlabeled dataset. This might seem similar to RL as both methods work with unlabeled datasets, but RL tries to maximize a reward signal instead of finding only hidden structures in the data. \r\n",

    "The first person to include uncertain lifetime and life insurance decisions in a discrete life-cycle model was Yaari {cite}`yaari1965uncertain`. He explored the model using a utility function without bequest (Fisher Utility function) and a utility function with bequest (Marshall Utility function) in a bounded lifetime. In both cases, he looked at the implications of including life insurance. Although Yaari's model was revolutionary in the sense that now the uncertainty of life could be modeled, Leung {cite}`leung1994uncertain` found that the constraints laid upon the Fisher utility function were not adequate and lead to terminal wealth depletion. Richard {cite}`richard1975optimal` applied the methodology of Merton {cite}`merton1969lifetime, merton1975optimum` to the problem setting of Yaari in a continuous time frame. Unfortunately, Richard's model had one deficiency: The bounded lifetime is incompatible with the dynamic programming approach used in Merton's model. As an individual approaches his maximal possible lifetime T, he will be inclined to buy an infinite amount of life insurance. To circumvent this Richard used an artificial condition on the terminal value. But due to the recursive nature of dynamic programming, modifying the last value would imply modifying the whole result. Ye {cite}`ye2006optimal`  found a solution to the problem by abandoning the bounded random lifetime and replacing it with a random variable taking values in $[0,\\infty)$. The models that replaced the bounded lifetime, are thereafter called intertemporal models as the models did not consider the whole lifetime of an individual but rather looked at the planning horizon of the consumer.  Note that the general setting of Ye {cite}`ye2006optimal` has a wide range of theoretical variables, while still upholding a flexible approach to different financial settings. On this account, it is a good baseline to confront the issues concerning the current models of financial planning. However, one of the downsides of the model is the abstract representation of the consumer. Namely, the rational consumer is studied, instead of the actual consumer. To detach the model from the notion of rational consumer, I will more closely look at behavioral concepts that can be implemented. In the next paragraph various modification will be discussed and a further review is conducted on the behavioral modifications\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "After Ye {cite}`ye2006optimal` various models have been proposed which all have given rise to unique solutions to the consumption, investment, and insurance problem. The first unique setting is a model with multiple agents involved. For example,  Bruhn and Steffensen {cite}`bruhn2011household` analyzed the optimization problem for couples with correlated lifetimes with their partner nominated as their beneficiary using a copula and common-shock model, while Wei et al.{cite}`wei2020optimal` studied optimization strategies for a household with economically and probabilistically dependent persons. Another setting is where certain constraints are used to better describe the financial situation of consumers. Namely, Kronborg and Steffensen {cite}`kronborg2015optimal` discussed two constraints. One constraint is a capital constraint on the savings in which savings cannot drop below zero. The other constrain involves a minimum return in savings. A third setting describes models who analyze the financial market and insurance market in a pragmatic environment. A good illustration is the study of Shen and Wei {cite}`shen2016optimal`. They incorporate all stochastic processes involved in the investment and insurance market where all randomness is described by a Brownian motion filtration. An interesting body of models is involved in time-inconsistent preferences. In this framework, consumers do not have a time-consistent rate of preference as assumed in the economic literature. There exists rather a divergence between earlier intentions and later choices De-Paz et al. {cite}`de2014consumption`. This concept is predominantly described in psychology. Specifically, rewards presented closer to the present are discounted proportionally less than rewards further into the future. An application of time-inconsistent preferences in the consumption, investment, and insurance optimization can be found in Chen and Li {cite}`chen2020time` and De-Paz et al. {cite}`de2014consumption`. These time-inconsistent preferences are rooted in a much deeper behavioral concept called future self-continuity. Future self-continuity can be described as how someone sees himself in the future. In classical economic theory, we assume that the degree to which you identify with yourself has no impact on the ultimate result. In the next subsection, the relationship of future self-continuity and time-inconsistent preferences are more closely looked at and future self-continuity is further examined in the behavioral life-cycle model.
