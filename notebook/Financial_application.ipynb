    "Advancements in Reinforcement Learning can be applied to a financial setting. In this subsection, a model is proposed for optimal consumption, life insurance and investment. This model can be extended in multiple ways and can be applied in a broad range of financial scenario's. The ony problem of the model is the curse of dimensionality which makes the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of the model in higher dimensions impossible to solve. A deep learning-based approach that can handle the HJB equation in higher dimensions is proposed. Although the method originates from optimal control literature, it resembles many feutures of the reinforcement algorithms and it solves the exact same problem.  "

    "The first person to include uncertain lifetime and life insurance decisions in a discrete life-cycle model was Yaari {cite}`yaari1965uncertain`. He explored the model using a utility function without bequest (Fisher Utility function) and a utility function with bequest (Marshall Utility function) in a bounded lifetime. In both cases, he looked at the implications of including life insurance. Although Yaari's model was revolutionary in the sense that now the uncertainty of life could be modeled, Leung {cite}`leung1994uncertain` found that the constraints laid upon the Fisher utility function were not adequate and lead to terminal wealth depletion. Richard {cite}`richard1975optimal` applied the methodology of Merton {cite}`merton1969lifetime, merton1975optimum` to the problem setting of Yaari in a continuous time frame. Unfortunately, Richard's model had one deficiency: The bounded lifetime is incompatible with the dynamic programming approach used in Merton's model. As an individual approaches his maximal possible lifetime T, he will be inclined to buy an infinite amount of life insurance. To circumvent this Richard used an artificial condition on the terminal value. But due to the recursive nature of dynamic programming, modifying the last value would imply modifying the whole result. Ye {cite}`ye2006optimal`  found a solution to the problem by abandoning the bounded random lifetime and replacing it with a random variable taking values in $[0,\\infty)$. The models that replaced the bounded lifetime, are thereafter called intertemporal models as the models did not consider the whole lifetime of an individual but rather looked at the planning horizon of the consumer.  Note that the general setting of Ye {cite}`ye2006optimal` has a wide range of theoretical variables, while still upholding a flexible approach to different financial settings. On this account, it is a good baseline to confront the issues concerning the current models of financial planning. However, one of the downsides of the model is the abstract representation of the consumer. Namely, the rational consumer is studied, instead of the actual consumer. To detach the model from the notion of rational consumer, I will more closely look at behavioral concepts that can be implemented. In the next paragraph various modification will be discussed and a further review is conducted on the behavioral modifications\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "After Ye {cite}`ye2006optimal` various models have been proposed which all have given rise to unique solutions to the consumption, investment, and insurance problem. The first unique setting is a model with multiple agents involved. For example,  Bruhn and Steffensen {cite}`bruhn2011household` analyzed the optimization problem for couples with correlated lifetimes with their partner nominated as their beneficiary using a copula and common-shock model, while Wei et al.{cite}`wei2020optimal` studied optimization strategies for a household with economically and probabilistically dependent persons. Another setting is where certain constraints are used to better describe the financial situation of consumers. Namely, Kronborg and Steffensen {cite}`kronborg2015optimal` discussed two constraints. One constraint is a capital constraint on the savings in which savings cannot drop below zero. The other constrain involves a minimum return in savings. A third setting describes models who analyze the financial market and insurance market in a pragmatic environment. A good illustration is the study of Shen and Wei {cite}`shen2016optimal`. They incorporate all stochastic processes involved in the investment and insurance market where all randomness is described by a Brownian motion filtration. An interesting body of models is involved in time-inconsistent preferences. In this framework, consumers do not have a time-consistent rate of preference as assumed in the economic literature. There exists rather a divergence between earlier intentions and later choices De-Paz et al. {cite}`de2014consumption`. This concept is predominantly described in psychology. Specifically, rewards presented closer to the present are discounted proportionally less than rewards further into the future. An application of time-inconsistent preferences in the consumption, investment, and insurance optimization can be found in Chen and Li {cite}`chen2020time` and De-Paz et al. {cite}`de2014consumption`. These time-inconsistent preferences are rooted in a much deeper behavioral concept called future self-continuity. Future self-continuity can be described as how someone sees himself in the future. In classical economic theory, we assume that the degree to which you identify with yourself has no impact on the ultimate result. In the next subsection, the relationship of future self-continuity and time-inconsistent preferences are more closely looked at and future self-continuity is further examined in the behavioral life-cycle model.

    "An other way to look at it is that the stochastic control problem is a model-based reinforcement learning problem {cite}`han2018solving`. In this setting $Z$ is viewed as the policy we try to approximate using a feedforward neural network. The process $u(t, \\varepsilon + W_t), t \\in [0, T]$, corresponds to the value function associated with the stochastic control problem and can be approximately employed by the policy Z {cite}`weinan2017deep`. A benefit of using deep BSDE method is does not require us to generate training data beforehand. The paths play the role of the data and they are generated on the spot {cite}`weinan2020algorithms`. \r\n",

This means that in order to obtain an approximate of $Y_t = u(t,X_t)$ at a later time $t>0$, we will have to retain our algorithm. {cite}`raissi2018forward` solves this isue by directly placing a neural network on the object of interest, the unknown solution $u(t,x)$\r\n"
